# Introduction to R Markdown
It's important during research to keep a thorough record of your undertakings. This is a common practice within the wet lab with all researchers keeping a lab book. However when it comes statistics and plots, people are less cautious about recording what they have done. R has several nice ways to record your activites, and make these as reproducible as possible including R Scripts and R Markdown. As a researcher who uses R on a daily basis, I started out using R Scripts to record my research. However, I've often found myself lost in a 1000 line script, trying to work out what each line of script is doing and what plots are produced. Even with thorough notation of the script, this can often still be confusing. R Markdown is a nice solution to this situation, allowing you to group your code into "chunks" as well as acting like a notebook, with plots pictured directly below the code. It also has the ability to the render the R Markdown into PDF, html or word document formats, allowing for easy production of reports.

This workshop has been largely inspired by the fantastic resources available at the [R Markdown Website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html)
